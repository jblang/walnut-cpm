LPUT20.LBR   - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   LPUT builds LU/NULU-identical LBR files and adds/replaces members. 
   ZCPR3-dependent, it's fully compatible with Plu*Perfect DateStamper, 
   converting dates supplied by DS or imbedded by CR23D.COM to the DRI- 
   style format specified in LUDEF5.DOC. Version 2.0 stores create and 
   modify times as well as dates in the LBR directory.  Also, the command 
   line parser now accepts an input filespec of dir: which is equivalent to 
   dir:*.*.  -- Howard GLOLDSTEIN, 4/06/91

POKE11.LBR   - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   This release of the Z33+ memory poker implements word-wide operations 
   when a hex number of three or more digits is used. This is particularly 
   useful when used with late-model aliases and their pointer capability, 
   which returns word-wide values. Through judicious use of POKE11, these 
   values can be passed to system registers for use for flow control in 
   subsequent aliases or with RESOLVE, etc.  7/12/91

Z-RIP13.LBR  - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   This version of the ZCPR3 Rapid Install Program has a number of 
   functional and cosmetic improvements, including Type 4 support and 
   improved filename display.  Still only 1K.  Since modern CPRs 
   auto-install the environment pointer, Z-RIP is really of value mostly to 
   programmers, to help ensure valid debugging results.  Z-RIP is Copyright 
   1986 by Paul Pomerleau. Version 1.3 by Bruce Morgen, 4/4/91, fixes the 
   FCB init. bug introduced in 1.2.

-----
LREPAIR.LBR  - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   LREPAIR is an LBR file integrity tester with limited correction 
   capabilities.  It reports the CRC of all or the selected member files to 
   the CRT, along with whether its findings agree with the values stored in 
   the LBR directory.  If the stored CRC is 0000h and the member file isn't 
   empty (as is the case for LBRs written to by LBRDISK or old versions of 
   LU and NULU), it will fix the CRC, as well as strip any high bits in 
   member filename entries.

-----
REMIND12.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   REMIND is an appointment reminder utility for ZCPR3 and ZSDOS with 
   clock.  It displays [and can print] a sorted and paged list of dated 
   appointment reminder lines, with optional time entries, from a text 
   datafile, starting with any currently dated reminders.  Can write a new 
   sorted datafile.  Include REMIND in your startup alias to automatically 
   display today's appointments and/or upcoming reminders.  V1.2 has bug 
   fixes, adds TPA check.  See REMIND12.HZP.

-----
CL10.LBR     - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   CL is a highly enhanced version of a utility created by Michal Carson in 
   early 1989.  Its main function is to "compact" an LBR file, that is, to 
   eliminate the "dead space" caused by member files marked as "deleted."  
   CL performs this task without the disk space appetite of LU's "-R" or 
   NULU's "-K," and is itself only 4K in length.  It can also erase members 
   from the LBR, lists and wildcards allowed. For CP/M 2.2, with runtime 
   ZCPR3 support.

MYLOAD11.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   This version of Hal Bower's MLOAD alternative adds TINIT/DINIT calls, 
   Program Error Flag Support, improved Z3 filename parsing, and the 
   program's actual (EFCB) name in the syntax help screen.  Improvements to 
   the LIBs enable this to be done while keeping MYLOAD under the 4K mark.

ROMAN10.LBR  - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   A vital ZCPR3 utility that converts between decimal numbers and Roman 
   numerals.  Works from the command line, or in interactive mode.  Version 
   1.0 converts either way, and includes a standard COM file that runs 
   under vanilla CP/M, Type-3 (loading at 8000h), and Type-4 versions.  How 
   can you pass this up?

-----
ZDT09.LBR    - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   ZDT is an evaluation release of the Z-System Day Timer, a daily planning 
   calendar derived from ZDB.  If your system has a real- time clock, ZDT 
   automatically reads it and displays the current day's schedule, checking 
   the data file for any previously entered appointments, memos, etc.  ZDT 
   will also work with manual date entry.  Requires ZCPR 3.0 or higher, 
   VLIB4+ and extended TCAP.  Small, feature packed just like ZDB.  Release 
   0.9 fixes a bug in 0.8B which caused ZDT to lose track of the date.

COMENT21.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   Rick Conn's ultra-simple ZCPR3 "chat" tool gets a tune-up after 
   nearly seven years (I know, who uses it anyway?).  The line-wrap 
   algorithm is now slightly less primitive, the Z3 environment is 
   consulted to obtain the screen width, the wheel byte is checked 
   before allowing the printer to be toggled on.  Type 3 format with 
   safety header implemented, still only five records long due to Z80 
   opcodes and overall tightening.  From '89, released April 15, 1991

-----
NAME12.LBR   - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   Minor update of the quick ZCPR3 directory name changer.  The help 
   message has been enhanced and a Type 4 version has been implemented.  
   Still well under 2K and the easiest-to-use tool for NDR 
   manipulation.  Use with SAVNDR and a system loader (JetLdr, NZCOM, 
   LLDR, LDR, etc.) or with a "system snapshot" utility (SNAP, LAP, 
   NZBLITZ, etc.) to make changes permanent. Version 1.2 is recoded to 
   work with the new, bugs-fixed Z3LIB.

-----
TXTALIAS.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   TXTALIAS is a true ZCPR3 tool that "compiles" standlone aliases from 
   standard ASCII "source" files.  Conceptually similar to ACREATE and 
   BA24, but supports assembler-style comments and multiple newlines in 
   the source file, has Joe Wright's latest ALIAS0 built-in rather than 
   using a separate "alias template" file, allows VALIAS-style 
   "recursive" aliases, and has Program Error Flag support for 
   automation of alias "development."

-----
ZFIND13.LBR  - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   ZCPR3 string search utility very quickly finds ASCII strings in text 
   files using the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm.  Similar to Irv 
   Hoff's FIND.COM, but MUCH faster.  Matched string can be displayed 
   in either the line or the delimited block in which it was found, and 
   the output can be written or appended to a file. Fast lookups in 
   magazine article index or MAST.CAT files.  Vers 1.3 fixes file 
   output bug.  See ZFIND13.NZW, ZFIND13.HZP.

   ZCPR3 disk/user statistics utility displays disk block size, disk 
   capacity, allocated and free space, and a list of active user areas.  
   For each active user area, it displays any label filename found 
   (-LABEL), the number of files and directory entries as well as the 
   total number of files and directory entries and, except under 
   Z3PLUS, an optional disk allocation bitmap.  Combines DSKMAP and 
   many functions of UMAP.

UMAP17.LBR   - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   This ZCPR3 utility can show a brief disk map: which users have files 
   and how many directory entries the files use.  Or it can show only a 
   brief summary of the number of entries used, the number still free, 
   and free disk space.  Or it can show a list of empty directories.  
   With Type-3 and Type-4 versions.  Version 1.7 displays directory 
   name for each user.

LBREXT32.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   Version 3.2 of the Z-System librrary file extract utility contains 
   the following changes:  Create and modify times are automatically 
   read from the LBR directory.  The code that forced all extractions 
   to the default directory if Wheel not set has been removed. 
   Optimized I/O routines result in slightly better performance.

NZBLTZ14.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 01/20/92
   NZCOM system save/load utility creates stand-alone COM files that 
   will load fully configured NZCOM systems in a fraction of the time 
   of an ordinary NZCOM load.  Configure with ZCNFG to save up to 
   CBIOS, top-of-memory or to a specified address, which allows saving 
   systems that have above-CBIOS Z-system buffers as well as the fully 
   configured/initialized CBIOS.  Can be included in alias scripts for 
   quick system customization.  See NZBLTZ14.ZZ0 for revision history.

   years, implements a Type 4 version under 4K in size, significantly 
   downsizes the MYSORT module, and introduces WILDEN, a wildcard 
   expansion module derived from WILDEX that detects whether its host 
   program is a Type 4 and allocates buffer space accordingly.  No 
   operational changes from Version 1.0.

   ATTRIB is a filename attribute management program similar in output 
   format to the MS-DOS command of the same name.  It provides a very 
   flexible, fully Z3 compatible way to set and reset all attributes on 
   selected files.  ATTRIB is wheel sensitive and may be safely used on 
   RCPM systems.  Although ATTRIB is Z3 aware, it can be used on any CP/M 
   system using a Z80 processor with or without ZCPR3.

   IMP was the first program known to utilize the automatic stepdown 
   feature offered by 2400 bps modems.  It also was the first program 
   that had automatic 1k protocol for faster file transfers at either 
   1200 or 2400 bps.  All KMD pgms as well as XMODEM 112 and later 
   support automatic 1k protocol.  Both KMD/YMODEM and MODEM7 types of

EXL.LBR - CP/M Archive Utility          (C3:)        Rcvd: 09/28/91
   EXL is a program that will type or print squeezed (.?Q?) crunched 
   (.?Z?) or LZH compressed (.?Y?) files. It will also uncompress 
   these to a disk file. In addition, it will do this directly out of 
   a .LBR file, so it is possible to type a LZH compressed file that 
   is inside a .LBR, or print it, or extract it to disk. It also has 
   full user area support: users 0 through 31 can be accessed.

   libraries of compressed subfiles created with Phil Katz's PKZIP file 
   archiving program for MS-DOS.  For the first time, ZTYPE allows CP/M 
   users to view the contents of such files without first extracting 
   them.  ZTYPE works with all CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3.0, and compatible 
   systems having at least 45.5k of TPA.  BDS C source code included.

   Version 1.4 of CMD introduces a major change in prompted operation -- 
   CMD now reinvokes itself after each command until an empty command 
   line (a RETURN alone) or a Control-C is entered. Control-C also exits 
   the current shell (if any) as in Version 1.3.  In this way, CMD can 
   act like an MS-DOS or UNIX "secondary shell" invocation for true 
   Z-System shells as well as for "ZCPR2- style" shells like MEX with 
   MEX2Z or Sage-modified WS4.

   Z System Display Editor, version 1.6.  A small, fast, powerful 
   WordStar-type text editor for all CP/M and compatible systems with 
   the Z80 processor.  In some ways superior to its big brother VDE, 
   this version of ZDE adds fully functional Auto-Indent capabilities, 
   Proportional Formatting, Auto-Recall of last response to prompts, 
   Global Find/Replace, Return to Previous Position (^QP) and more to 
   what many felt was already the best editor available for CP/M.

ZDEMACRO.LBR - CP/M Wordproc. Utility   (D6:)        Rcvd: 06/17/91
   ZDE macro keys.  Most of them are derived or directly from the 
   SAMPKEY files found in ZDE16.LBR.  But the one macro key that 
   prompts the distribution of this .LBR is a macro which both softens 
   a hard-carriaged paragraph *AND* then reformats the paragraph.  
   SAMPKEY had a Soften key, but it did not reformat the file -- you 
   had to use another macro key to reformat the file.  For ZDE, 
   install with the command ZDENSTAL ZDE ZDEMACRO.ZDK.

   version 1.1.  NZ-COM, JetLDR, or Z3PLUS is required to use these 
   files.  The modules are named as RCP-nnxy.ZRL where "nn" is the 
   size of the RCP in records, "x" is either "F" for floppy systems or 
   "H" for fixed disk systems, and "y" is "C" if the new command line 
   editor shell is included.  You probably won't want to download all 
   of the .ZRL modules.  See Z34RCP11.LBR for source code.

   articles from The Computer Journal and the collection here probably 
   represents the closest the Z system community has to a complete Z 
   system users and programmers manual.  These are highly recommended 
   reading for anyone wishing to learn the details of ZCPR3 and the 
   utilities and applications written for it.

EXPRES11.ARK - CP/M Wordproc. Utility   (D6:)        Rcvd: 05/23/91
   EXPRESS is a full screen text editor for CP/M.  This version (1.1) 
   is a "preliminary and limited implementation" of EXPRESS 2.0, which 
   is (was?) a commercial product.  Some of the features are limited, 
   but still present.  Those totally absent seem to be mainly of the 
   "system" type, such as deleting or copying of files from within the 
   editor.
   
-----
HIST197.LBR - CP/M General Utility      (D0:)        Rcvd: 05/21/91
   History197 allows you to recall previously entered CP/M command lines 
   (up to 23) for reuse or editing.  No more retyping of long commands 
   because you mistyped a character!  Currently set up for Kaypro II 
   keycodes.  Patching info to change this is included.

   SYSOP NOTE:  LSHQ.LBR, while filed in the ZCPR3 directory, provides 
   the same facility for generic CP/M.  Since previous commands are 
   stored to disk, the command history size is limited only by available
   disk space.  LSH also provides filename completion, in case you can't
   remember the name of file in a specified directory.

EGUITL53.LBR - CP/M General Utility     (D0:)        Rcvd: 04/19/91
   A collection of utilities for CP/M by Eric Gans.  Originally written 
   on a Kaypro 10, some programs use K-10 video attributes.  Most use 
   Z80 code and are generic to CP/M 2.2.

   SYSOP NOTE:  Eric Gans is a very innovataive programmer.  Many of his 
   programs were ahead of the times when they were written and are still 
   uniuqe, providing functions not found elsewhere.  As far as I know, 
   Eric was the first programmer to write a screen dump BIOS overlay for 
   the Kaypro 10.  This library is highly recommended if you have a 
   Kaypro 10.

MXCAT6G.LBR - CP/M General Utility      (D0:)        Rcvd: 04/02/91
   An excellent disk cataloging utility.  This is a beta release from 
   the author, Hal Bower and as it is several years old, it has probably
   been superceded by a later version.  It is, however, a good program, 
   and works well.  MCAT6G catalogs the contents of .LBR files.  Disk 
   tags must be confined to the 3 character filename extension, requiring
   renaming of disks for users of older versions of MCAT who used the 
   full filename form.   Recommended by the sysop of this BBS.

-----
LABEL.LBR - CP/M General Utility        (D0:)        Rcvd: 04/02/91

   long.
   
-----
FATCAT24.LBR - CP/M General Utility     (D0:)        Rcvd: 04/02/91
   CP/M Disk Catologue Utility, FATCAT Version 2.4, the FATter but 
   faster disk CATologuer. Turbo Pascal  general installation. Included 
   is UNCR.com to uncruch the files as they are crunched to save space. 
   The size of this file is 157824 bytes.

   SYSOP NOTE:  While FATCAT is a many-featured cataloging program, and 
   does an adequate job, it is indeed a very fat cat, and recommended 
   only if you have lots of extra disk space for your catalogs and their 
   related index files.
   
-----
COPY171.LBR - CP/M General Utility      (D0:)        Rcvd: 03/30/91
   This update of the ZSDOS file copying program offers improved control 
   over the erasure of read-only files.  It also contains many bug fixes 
   and should now work correctly uner ZRDOS, Z3Plus and even vanilla 
   CP/M.
     Howard Goldstein/Hal Bower, 3/24/91
   
   SYSOP NOTE:  If you are using CP.COM vs. 4.9 as supplied with NZ-COM
   you should replace it with this program.  CP49 has a nasty bug which 
   will cause lost files if the target directory is full.

   It does no writing, so it poses no danger to your directory or to 
   !!!TIME&.DAT files.  It calls error handler on error so ZEX or SUB 
   can be aborted.  It checks for duplicate entries, extents and users 
   greater than 31, records greater than 128, illegal filename 
   characters, duplicate allocation groups assignments.  For ZCPR3 only.

   SAP60 is a utility to clean up the disk directory tracks of a CP/M 
   disk.  It works equally well on tiny floppy drives or hard drives in 
   excess of 100 Mb capacity.  It will check the directory to see how 
   many files it contains, check memory to see sufficient is available, 
   read filenames into memory from the directory tracks and clean off 
   the entire directory area.   Uses a fast sort routine to sort 
   programs and then put the names back on the disk in alphabetic order.
   
-----
LBREXT31.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility            (B5:)        Rcvd: 03/29/91

   the following changes:  The member name defaults to *.* if a 
   destination directory is given with no file name.  The program no 
   longer aborts if a CRC error is encountered.  ZCNFG can be used for 
   program configuration.

   B. Falconer's excellent Library Typer program with this update.  
   Excellent for TYPE.COM use.  Can type normal, LZH-encoded, crunched 
   or squeezed files - whether standalone or in a .LBR.  If wheel is on, 
   can also easily extract any/all files, and uncrunch and/or unsqueeze 
   at the same time.  (This is the missing feature in NULU152.)  Most 
   useful program for either RCP/M use or for individual CP/M systems.
           
-----
LPUT18.LBR - ZCPR3 Utility              (B5:)        Rcvd: 03/29/91

   ZCPR3-dependent, it's fully compatible with Plu*Perfect DateStamper, 
   converting dates supplied by DS or imbedded by CR23D.COM to the DRI- 
   style format specified in LUDEF5.DOC.  This version is completely 
   compatible with ZSDOS and can pick up P2D or DateStamper style dates 
   directly from the DOS.   It now works correctly under Z3PLUS.
