.. Substitute your own program name for PROGRAMNAME and your own
.. installation program name for INSTALLNAME in the following.
..
TERMINAL INSTALLATION


Before you use PROGRAMNAME,  it must be installed to your particu
lar  terminal,  i.e.  provided with information regarding  control
characters  required for certain functions.  This installation  is
easily  performed using the program INSTALLNAME which is described
in the following.

After  having  made a work-copy,  please store  your  distribution
diskette safely away and work only on the copy.

Now start the installation by typing INSTALLNAME at your terminal.
Select Screen installation from the main menu.  Depending on  your
version of PROGRAMNAME,  the installation proceeds as described in
the following two sections.

   Which terminal? (Enter no. or ^X to exit):
------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Terminal Installation Menu

If your terminal is mentioned,  just enter the corresponding  num
ber,  and  the  installation is complete.  Before installation  is
actually performed, you are asked the question:

------------------------------------------------------------------
   Do you want to modify the definition before installation?
------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows you to modify one or more of the values being  instal
led  as described in the following.  If you do not want to  modify
the  terminal definition,  just type N,  and the installation com
pletes by asking you the operating frequency of your CPU (see last
item in this appendix).

If your terminal is not on the menu,  however, you must define the
required values yourself. The values can most probably be found in
the manual supplied with your terminal.

Enter the number corresponding to None of the above and answer the
questions one by one as they appear on the screen.

In  the following,  each command you may install is  described  in
detail. Your terminal may not support all the commands that can be
installed.  If  so,  just  pass the command not needed  by  typing
RETURN in response to the prompt.  If Delete line, Insert line, or
Erase  to  end of line is not installed,  these functions will  be
emulated in software, slowing screen performance somewhat.

Commands may be entered either simply by pressing the  appropriate
keys  or by entering the decimal or hexadecimal ASCII value of the
command.  If  a command requires the two characters  'ESCAPE'  and
'=', may:

either Press  first  the Esc key,  then the =.  The entry will  be
       ecchoed with appropriate labels, i.e. <ESC> =.
or     Enter  the  decimal  or  hexadecimal  values  separated  by
       spaces.  Hexadecimal  values must be preceded by a  dollar-
       sign.  Enter e.g. 27 61  or  $1B 61  or  $1B $3D  which are
       all equivalent.

The two methods cannot be mixed, i.e. once you have entered a non-
numeric  character,  the rest of that command must be  defined  in
that mode, and vise versa.

A  hyphen entered as the very first character is used to delete  a
command, and ecchoes the text Nothing.

Terminal type:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the name of the terminal you are about to install.  When you
complete INSTALLNAME,  the values will be stored, and the terminal
name  will appear on the initial list of terminals.  If you  later
need  to re-install PROGRAMNAME to this terminal,  you can do that
by choosing it from the list.

Send an initialization string to the terminal?
------------------------------------------------------------------
If  you want to initialize your terminal when  PROGRAMNAME  starts
(e.g.  to  download commands to programmable function  keys),  you
answer Y for yes to this question. If not, just hit RETURN.

If  you  answer  Y,  you may choose between entering  the  command
directly  or defining a file name containing the  command  string.
The latter is a good idea if the initialization string is long, as
e.g. a string to program a number of function keys would be.

Send a reset string to the terminal?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Here,  you  may  define a string to be sent to the  terminal  when
PROGRAMNAME terminates. The description of the initialization com
mand above applies here.

CURSOR LEAD-IN command:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Cursor  Lead-in  is a special sequence of characters  which  tells
your  terminal that the following characters are an address on the
screen on which the cursor should be placed.

When you define this command,  you are asked the following supple
mentary questions:
.cp10
       CURSOR POSITIONING COMMAND to send between line and column:
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Some terminals need a command between the two numbers defi
       ning the row- and column cursor address.

       CURSOR POSITIONING COMMAND to send after line and column:
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Some  terminals need a command after the two numbers  defi
       ning the row- and column cursor address.

       Column first?
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Most  terminals require the address on  the  format:  first
       ROW,  then  COLUMN.  If this is the case on your  terminal,
       answer  N.  If your terminal wants COLUMN first,  then ROW,
       then answer Y.

       OFFSET to add to LINE
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Enter the number to add to the LINE (ROW) address.

       OFFSET to add to COLUMN
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Enter the number to add to the COLUMN address.

       Binary address?
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Most terminals need the cursor address sent on binary form.
       If that is true for your terminal,  enter Y. If your termi
       nal expects the cursor address as ASCII digits, enter N. If
       so, you are asked the supplementary question:

          2 or 3 ASCII digits?
          ---------------------------------------------------------
          Enter  the  number of digits in the cursor  address  for
          your terminal.

CLEAR SCREEN command:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter  the  command that will clear the entire  contents  of  your
screen, both foreground and background, if applicable.

Does CLEAR SCREEN also HOME cursor?
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is normally the case; if it is not so on your terminal, enter
N, and define the cursor HOME command.

DELETE LINE command:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the command that deletes the entire line at the cursor posi
tion.

INSERT LINE command:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the command that inserts a line at the cursor position.

ERASE TO END OF LINE command:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the command that erases the line at the cursor position from
the cursor position through the right end of the line.

START OF 'LOW VIDEO' command:
------------------------------------------------------------------
If your terminal supports different video intensities, then define
the command that initiates the dim video here.  If this command is
defined, the following question is asked:

       START OF 'NORMAL VIDEO' command:
       ------------------------------------------------------------
       Define  the command that sets the screen to show characters
       in 'normal' video.

Number of rows (lines) on your screen:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the number of horizontal lines on your screen.

Number of columns on your screen:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the number of vertical column positions on your screen.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Delay after CURSOR ADDRESS (0-255 ms):
Delay after CLEAR, DELETE, and INSERT (0-255 ms):
Delay after ERASE TO END OF LINE and HIGHLIGHT On/Off (0-255 ms):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter  the  delay  in milliseconds required  after  the  functions
specified. RETURN means 0 (no delay).

Is this definition correct?
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have made any errors in the definitions,  enter N. You will
then return to the terminal selection menu.  The installation data
you  haver just entered will be included in the installation  data
file and appear on the terminal selection menu,  but  installation
will not be performed.

When you enter Y in response to this question, you are asked:

------------------------------------------------------------------
Operating frequency of your microprocessor in MHz (for delays):
------------------------------------------------------------------
As  the  delays specified earlier are depending on  the  operating
frequency of your CPU, you must define this value.

The  installation  is finished,  installation data is  written  to
PROGRAMNAME,  and you return to the outer menu.  New  installation
data  is  also  saved in the installation data file  and  the  new
terminal  will appear on the terminal selection list when you  run
