                    Z P M 3   by Simeon Cran
                    ========================
          A Z80 coded CP/M 3.0 compatible BDOS replacement.

ZPM3 offers all the good things that CP/M 3.0 does, and then it 
offers more. Because ZPM3 is written in Z80 code rather than the 
8080 code of CP/M 3.0, it can do everything that CP/M 3.0 does, 
but in much less space. With the extra space recovered, ZPM3 
packs in a number of new facilities. Yet the whole package fits 
in exactly the same space as CP/M 3.0 so you can directly replace 
your old CP/M 3.0 BDOS with ZPM3 without a worry.

ZPM3 is also fast. Faster, in fact, than CP/M 3.0. This is 
possible because the rich Z80 instruction set allows many 
algorithms to be implemented more efficiently. In addition, the 
extra space available in ZPM3 has been put to use to further 
optimise the code. Lots of small optimisations smooth the 
execution flow, so ZPM3 becomes the fastest operating system on 
most banked CP/M computers.
----------

This is version 1.0.......
You do not need to compile a new CP/M system (like before..zpm v0.8) !
The makezpm utilities will work with CP/M on the C128.....!

Most C128 users cannot generate a new system as no sys gen. utilities
(eg., LINK, GENCPM, ADDBIOS, etc) were included with the original-factory
CPM+.SYS system diskette.
