Hi All,

QWKRR128 V3.1 just came in the door (neatly folded by the posties, as
usual). I will upload it here when I call to post this packet, so you
can Freq away as soon as you see this note. The name is QWKRRV31.SFX.
Rod included a "README" file that contains information which will be
useful to new users as well, so I'm posting it here. If you are going
to Freq it, save this as it may not be in the .SFX.

G'Day peoples,
    Before I go any further this is a form letter so I apologise for
not having quite the same personal touch that is normally sent with my
disks.

Firstly, for those of you that a getting a registered copy of QWKRR for
the first time I would like to thank you for your support. It is only
due to your support that the program has developed as far as it has
(with even more to come).

For those of you recieving this disk as an upgrade will notice that I
have taken a different approach to usual.

Rather than pre-register the program for each of you, you will find the
disk contains only this file and the distribution SFX.  (with a backup
on the back side of the disk.

Both files are indentical for each and every one of you, and I request
that this be the only format for distribution.

If you unpack and run the program "as is" it will always configure
itself as unregistered, therefore you must register it before use.

As mentioned in the documents this is done with the small utility
program included called "registerqwkrr".
This is a quick, painless, once only procedure that hopefully will give
no-one any problems.

Included with this disk will be a small printout with your name(s),
registration number(s), and confirmation code(s).

If for any reason the confirmation code doesn't match the code given by
the registration program procede no further and contact me as soon as
possible.

As with previous versions of QWKRR even if the confirmation codes are
correct the program will re-configure to unregistered format if the
name in the CONTROL.DAT file doesn't match. If this happens with you
when it shouldn't then again contact me so that I can rectify the
problem.

IMPORTANT: Keep your registration and confirmation codes in a safe
place. I am hoping to stay with this same code with all future
upgrades. If you keep a record of your own codes you should be able to
upgrade to any later releases without bothering me ;-)
It will of course save us all some expense.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the doc's or my registration form,
any new registrations recieved will result in me sending the codes
only. NOT a disk copy of the program (I assume anyone registering will
already be a user of the shareware configured program).
If a netmail address is sent with the registration fee I shall send
these codes via netmail as well as snail mail. In all cases the codes
will be posted out by conventional means.

I trust that you will all keep this in mind and explain it to any new
QWKRR128 users that may ask about it.

I will make a determined effort that all future releases will be made
readily available to all by sending out disk copies to those people
that have sent me more $$ than required, and probably also to the most
active users of the CBM fido echo at that time. Going from past
experience these upgrades seem to find very rapid re-distribution via
BBS network so hopefully no-one will be disadvantaged.
I will also try to confirm that _all_ registered users can/do indeed
get any upgrades.

I am more than happy to hear of your views of this distribution plan.

Anyway, thats about all I have to say, and as usual I do appreciate any
feedback, suggestions etc. I do have lots of ideas of my own, and with
your input we can make it even better.

Enjoy QWKRR V3.1 and I'll catch most of you on the echo.

Cheers
Rod
