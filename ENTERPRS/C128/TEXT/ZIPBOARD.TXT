OK, I've got the definitive accelerator board form.

About using the accelerator board in 64 mode, JBEE says that he doesn't see
any reason why you shouldn't get acceleration in 64 mode- so it sounds like
this might be a "renaissance" accelerator board.

I don't know what the deadline for getting the $50 deposit in is yet, and I am
not sure that the deadline is set, but I would imagine that y'all have at
least a few weeks or a month before it is too late.  But, to be safe, send in
your $50 deposit NOW to be assured of getting an accelerator board.  For those
of you who are thinking that you'll wait and see how the first run goes before
buying one, be aware that those who don't send in a $50 deposit to reserve one
may never have the opportunity to buy one of these boards.
