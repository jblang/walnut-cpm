I have been trying to get several Apple Hardware developers to support the
Commodore. Specifically for speed up! This is an editied exchange I had with
the online Rep for ZIP Technologies here on GEnie!

do you really think that you will ever come up with a 128 or 64 accellerator?

 I am 100% certain on the C-64 and almost sure on the C-128.

 I am going ahead with them :X  Once I have something concrete to post I
 will, which will probably be before the end of the month.  As a few of
 the "insiders" know I haven't exactly been sitting still, things just
 take time and I don't want to post details unless they are concrete.
 
 Though I guarantee once I do people will be pleased :)

ThThe president of my local user group sent in his $50 on this accellerator. I
can't say that he has been optimistic about ever seeing anything come out of
it.  Is there anything I can tell him that is of any good?

 Bil Herd a former Commodore engineer has agreed to help me produce the
 speed-up board for the C-128.  Actually, Bil is the one that helped
 design both the C-128 and REUs (sys 32800,123,45,6).  I expect to have
 him here shortly under the CBM-PRESS account.
 
 I will also have a few other experts helping out on the project, some
 which are already online ;)
 
 Once we have everything planned out and the directions set for the
 design goals I will post more here and have a RTC.
 
 I would say at this point it is a go :)

 This is good news!!!
 
 Now, if we can also persuade Bil to relate a bit of Commodore lore
 while he is up and about, we are all in for a huge treat.  And, it is
 not all that difficult to persuade Bil.  :)
 
 But I guess we should also let him have a spare moment or two so
 that he can do a bit of design too.

 Say, JeBEE, if the outlook on the ZIP CHIP looks okay at this point, are you
still wanting people to send in deposits?  Or are you going to wait and see
how  the pworojusect goes first?

 I don't want any more deposits or survey sheets and have been returning
 the few stray deposits that have arrived (except for one from Sweden because
 I know the guy had to go to a lot of trouble to send it).
 
 I am going to delete the "zip" survey I uploaded in a few minutes.

Looks like I've gotten into this topic a little bit late.  Is there a way to
get on a waiting list, since at this point deposits are no longer  being
accepted?
 
I've got a technical question of sorts.  How does the speed up affect such
programs as telecommunication programs that involve timing to work, such as
for up/downloading, etc?  Seems to me there could be a potential  problem
using existing programs.  Several of the local Commodore boards have been
discussing this with who knows what facts they have to back them  up, and I'm
dying to find out how much software would be instantly  compatible with the
zip.

 There is no waiting list.
 
 Anything that uses the 1mhz bus and CIAs for timing will be okay, software
 that uses ML loops for timing will run too fast?  Since my tests with
 Dialogue 128 downloading at 9600 were 95%+ eff on the GEnie 9600 WATS
 line I do not see where the board will speed up or improve any telecom
 session worth mentioning or to justify purchasing the cartridge.
 
 Where it will make a big improvement is in programs with a lot of processor
 overhead like graphic applications (Basic 8) and things like ARC.  Word
 processors will run a lot faster too since the VDC can accept data far
 faster than the 8502 can deliver it.
 
 The most exciting thing (for me) will be the ability to run applications
 in compiled languages such as C as fast as ML applications run now.  That
 will open up the possibility of a lot of new software easily ported
 from other machines.
 
 Of course things like Geos will fly :)

I know I use the jiffy timers at 160-162 for timing loops in BellTerm and
RTCMaster, including/especially for transfers.  Or will that be left at the
60/second rate too?  Currently that set of addresses is  updated by the system
IRQ.  But if the IRQ is significantly changed wrt timing, will it cause other
stuff to have problems.  I am not asking like I know the answer.... I don't...
just curious.

The normal system IRQ is triggered by the screen raster, rather than by
counting a certain number of system clock cycles.  Since the screen refresh
rate can't be changed by the ZIP board (or else all of our monitors will no
longer be good enough :), I would imagine that the IRQ's will still come at 1
per 60 seconds.  Which means you can get a lot more done between interrupts,
and a lot more done in an IRQ routine :).
 
Since the jiffy clock is updated by the IRQ routine, if my imagination that
IRQ's will still come at 1/60 seconds is correct, then software that uses the
ZP jiffy clock for timing will still probably work just fine.
 
By a similar token, terminal programs should still work fine.  When a byte
comes in on the RS232 port, it triggers a NMI, and the actual byte receiving
is done in that NMI.  Thus, the rate that byte triggers come in should not be
affected by the processor speed.  And, assuming a well written terminal
program, which makes sure it isn't overfilling the buffer, there shouldn't be
any problem with sending bytes, either.  (How does George Hug deal with
timing?)
 
Again, the terminal program will have many more clock cycles to process each
byte that comes in... visualize some pretty impessive online decompression.
Realtime GIF viewing, anybody? :D

Rob:  I know the 128 IRQ is tied to the raster interrupt, but I don't think
the one in the C64 is done that way.  As for normal RS232 i/o you are probably
on the money.  I'm talking about file transfer  protoocols where an event is
timed.... i.e. waiting for the SOH byte in all of the Xmodem derivative
protocols (Xmodem CRC/Checksum/1K/  Ymodem).  If the update rate of the
addresses 160-162 are changed that is going to affect any of these protocols.
George hug uses a countdown timer with a different calibration from the
standard  resident routines.  That is not the whole picture, but again, my
concern was never with the garden variety i/o, which is little more than a
glorified file-handling function (my opinion) and should  respond well to the
speed-up.  I was just concerned about things that used the Jiffy timer.  If
the interrupts are controlled at 60 per second this is probably all moot and
as you say, there will be lots more time to do things between the interrupts.

 Speed-up board update:
 Dennis Jarvis, the author of Basic 7.0 Internals by Abacus, an expert
 on both the DOS and OS for the Commodores, who also worked on the
 Turbo Master, will also be working on the new speed-up board.  Dennis
 will be our debugger and will be the one modifying the operating system
 as needed and offering his expert advice.
 
 A good customer who is an EE and also runs his own consulting business
 will be doing the board work (soldering, chip insertion, etc).
 
 So we have the team, we just have to rough out the plan :)
 
 Any suggestions for the name for the new board would be appreciated.
