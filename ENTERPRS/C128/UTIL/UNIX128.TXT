Notes For Unix 128 version 3.11
Gregg William Riedel     16 March 1992
--------------------------------------

Unix 128 is distributed as four ARC files (unixa-d.arc) and this file.
The ARCs were created using ARC128 under CS-DOS.

Building the system:
    1.  Dissolve the four ARC files.  These are NOT self-dissolving; use an
        ARC utility to dissolve them.  The files created should fit onto
        an empty double sided 5.25" diskette.
    2.  Run the program "make" (i.e.  RUN "MAKE" ).  This will create a
        slew of data files (write them to the same disk as the un-ARC'd
        files).

Logging in for the first time:
    1.  Load the system by typing RUN "STARTUP"
    2.  After the system loads, enter the username 'root' and the password
        'root'.
    3.  At the system prompt (%), type 'fsck'.  This will run the file
        system consistenct check program, which will create a new directory
        structure on the current disk.

For Help:
    It is recommended that you read the first few pages of the introductory
document supplied.  Do this by typing 'more intro.1 intro.2'.  The command
'more' will display a list of files, pausing at the bottom of each screen;
press [SPACE] to continue or [Q] to quit.  Also, to familiarize yourself
with the commands, a  manual browser has been provided; it is invoked by
typing 'browse'.
    There is a terse (i.e. unix-style) manual page available for each
command.  Access the manuals by typing 'man command-name'.  A complete
list of commands can be printed by typing 'commands'.


Good Luck!

Changes since version 3.10:
     I couldn't believe the amount of errors and omissions that I allowed to
slip through in version 3.10.  Error testing in a project of this size is
impossible....

     Here's a complete list of errors that were fixed,  and errors that remain:

Errors in version 3.11 (NOT FIXED):
-----------------------------------

   1.  The new shuffle for PUZZLE is intelligent (i.e. will always output
a solvable puzzle), but makes the puzzle too easy... a nastier shuffle
is needed.
   2.  There is a report of a DIR ERROR when 'more .passwd help.txt >outfile'
is typed; I often get directory errors so I cannot verify this one.  In
general, however, the following will NOT work:
          ext_command args > somefile
This is because executing an external command (by this I mean external to the
shell; examples are cat, od, hgrep...) closes the output file... I can
probably fix this, but it'll be ugly :(
   3.  I forgot #11 on the wumpus map!  Oops.
   4.  Commodore RAMDOS and Abacus' BASIC 128 compiler are incompatible.
So RAMDOS still doesn't work with this package.

Stupid Errors, Features, and Typos that were fixed:
---------------------------------------------------

(Thanks go out to John (cs202124@umbc5.umbc.edu) for all his help in tracking
down and killing all the undesirable features...)

1. In browse, P (print) didn't work.

2. bdiff, diff, and cmp couldn't handle binary files.  I added -t (text)
and -b (binary) command line options to deal with this.

3. Script files had to be of type (p) NOT (s) as created by emacs and
cat>filename.  Scripts can now be SEQ files.

4. When you use >> like 'ls >> listing' and the file listing doesn't exist,
it will give you some sort of file not open error and exit to basic.

5. fsck wouldn't work with subdirectories at all.

6. cp needed almost a complete re-write!

7. delete did nothing.

8. The file and size commands didn't work.

9. 'grep -i' didn't work.

10. lock didn't work with PRG files.

11. In mail, 's' (save a message) didn't work.

12. The rename part of 'mv' didn't work.

13. Lpr and pr didn't work for PRG file types.  No big deal.

14. puzzle didn't detect a win.

15. 'rm' deleted the file from the disk, but not from the directory (root.dir).

16. 'shar' just stalled and did nothing.

17. The split file count is one too low.

18. 'style intro.1' didn't work, but style worked on all of the other
text files... This was because style couldn't handle words over 50 characters
long.

19. 'ls -lo' was UGLY!!

20. In 'od', unprintable characters like [CLR] weren't screened out; this
was very ugly for PRG files.

21. ps should show the processes that are running (shell, ps, and the
print jobs).

22. 'tar' just stalled and basicaly did nothing.

23. zcat only worked with (n-1) files (i.e.: 'zcat a b c d' would only show
files a, b and c.
