UPTIME DISKS

All of the up time disks are to be UNZIPED, UNZIP64.SFX {MS-DOS ZIP}, and 
then use C=ommodore ZIPCODE to unzip the, 1!filename {all are PRG}, 
the image files.

Next you must have UNZIP.C64 {ZIPCODE} to dissolve the image files -
The directory will be something like:
        1!file
        2!file
        3!file
        4!file
