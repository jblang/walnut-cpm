                    USING THIS DISC AND THE VIEW PROGRAM

For better accessibility of this cdrom, we at Walnut Creek developed a
browsing program called "View."  Located in the root directory, this
"View" program allows the user to traverse through the directories and
examine all the file descriptions on the cdrom.  The view program in
general searches for files, extracts and uncompresses them from the
cdrom onto the user's hard drive.

To use the view program from MS-DOS, change the current drive to your
CD-ROM drive. Type "VIEW" at the root directory and press enter to
start the program.

To use the view program from MS-Windows, use the "Run" option under
Program Manager.  Assuming the cdrom drive is accessed through "D:",
type "D:\view.exe" into the command line box and click on the "OK"
button.  The view program can also be accessed through the File
Manager.  For information on how to use the File Manager, please
consult the MS-Windows manual.

Once started, the view program displays a listing of the directories
of the cdrom along with their content descriptions.  Use the arrow
keys to move the cursor bar up and down the list to select the desired
directory.  Pressing ENTER on any of the entries will bring the
program into that directory.  (To return back to the directory
listing, press the ESCAPE key.)  Once inside a directory, the view
program then displays an index of filenames along with the file
descriptions in that particular subdirectory.  Here the view program
allows the user to read text files, uncompress archived files, and
copy files onto other disk drives.

To read a text file from the file index menu, position the cursor bar
onto the file entry and press ENTER.  The view program will open up
the text file, and will allow the user to read and scroll through the
document.  While scrolling through a text file, searching of a text
string is accomplished by pressing the key 'S'.  (The key 'R' searches
a string in the reverse direction.)  To return back to the file index
menu after reading the text file, press the ESCAPE key.

To uncompress an archived file from the index menu, select the file
entry with the cursor bar and press ENTER.  In general, archived files
have names that end with the file extension ".zip", ".arc", or ".zoo".
After selecting an archived file for extracting, a "destination query"
screen will appear to ask for the directory where the archived file is
to be uncompressed.  A default destination directory will be already
suggested by the view program, printed and highlighted in the
destination box.  Press ENTER here to use the default directory, or
modify the default entry before pressing ENTER.  The user may also
scroll through some "suggested" default directories by using the
down-cursor key.  Once the ENTER key is pressed, the view program will
then create the destination directory if it doesn't already exist, and
begin to uncompress the archived file into that directory.

After the archived file is successfully uncompressed, the view program
then displays another index menu similar the previous one based on the
files extracted from the archive.  Here most of the "readme" files and
text files extracted are be labeled as documentations on the right
side.  Use the cursor bar to select these files to open them for
viewing.  Extracted files that have ".bat", ".com", or ".exe" as
extensions are executable files and are labeled as such on the right
side.  Selecting these files will run these applications on top of the
view program.  If wished, the extracted files can be removed from the
hard drive at this point by pressing the keys "Alt-R".  To return back
to the first index menu, press the ESC key.

To copy a file from the index menu, again highlight the file entry
with the cursor bar, and press the 'C' key.  A screen similar to that
from the archive uncompressing process will appear asking the user for
a destination.  Enter the desired directory name where the file is to
be placed, and press ENTER. The view program then copies the file to
the destination directory, and returns back to the file index menu.

You can also perform all of the above functions on the Global Index
File.  To jump into the Global Index File mode, press the keys
"Alt-G".  You will now be viewing the global index containing all of
the files on both discs.  You can search, view, and unzip from this
one large index file instead of having to enter multiple directories.  

At any stage of the program, hitting the ESC key always brings the
user back to the previous state -- so don't worry about accidentally
hitting a wrong key.  The On-line help is also provided at all stages
of the program.  Pressing the '?' key any time can bring up the help
screen.

===============================================================================

Trouble Shooting: 

Due to memory problems and the restrictions of other software, the
view program may at times conflict with other applications when
running them on top of itself.  Whenever any newly uncompressed
program retrieved from the cdrom doesn't run from the interactive file
menu, please try running it directly from MS-DOS or MS-Windows.  And
in most cases, a shareware program usually comes with its own
documentations and instructions.  These instructions are normally
stored in files such as "readme.txt".  Please read all documentation
included with a file before running a program.  Doing so will prevent
the occurrence of common problems that many users often encounter.

We hope that this view program will further improve the usability and the
quality of our cdroms.  Comments, suggestions, and criticisms are greatly
appreciated.  Thank you very much for using Walnut Creek CDROM products.
