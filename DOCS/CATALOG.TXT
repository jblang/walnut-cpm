sophisticated role game.  You will become Yamoussou Ouedraogo.  Yamoussou

thousands of villages scattered on the continent.  He has a family to take
care of.  Every year he must make difficult, life threatening decisions
about what to plant, what to buy, who to help, and more.  The world of
Yamoussou is a harsh but generous one.  Success is judged by your ability
to help your children and friends.  "Welcome to Africa" runs under Windows
3.1 on a PC compatible computer, 386 or above.  It is easy to use and
install. It's fun. It's beautiful.  Where else can you learn so much about
Africa?  $39.95.
