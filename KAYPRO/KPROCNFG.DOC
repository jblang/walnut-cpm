KPROMDM7.DOC  NON-LINEAR KAYCOMP KAYPRO II DOC FOR MODEM7.

AS OF 08/21/82.      Tom McCormick.  Houston, Tx.


This portable CP/M micro comes with an RS232c serial port,
a BAUD.COM utility to set the baud rates on that port, and
the SELECT editor with which to make the following changes
to MBOOT.ASM.

MBOOT.ASM is a minimal subset of MODEM7: all it will do is
operate in terminal mode, and then receive one file at a time
using the Christensen protocol of MODEM7.  It will not send,
auto dial, send/receive without handshaking, transfer multiple
files from a single command (wildcards), etc. like the full
MODEM7 program will do.   BUT...it is much much shorter to
key in the first time if you do not know anyone with MODEM7
on a KAYPRO II compatable 5" diskette.

Obtain a printed copy of MBOOT.ASM (free, public-domain), and
make the following changes.  You can then use MBOOT to transfer
the full MODEM7 program to yourself, and make the same changes
to it.

----------------------------------------------

Here are the MODEM7 values to patch for KCOMP.

04H   MODEM DATA PORT

06H   MODEM STATUS PORT

04H   BIT MASK: READY TO SEND

01H   BIT MASK: READY TO RECEIVE

----------------------------------------------

We connected the KAYPRO serial port directly to
an H-89 serial port as follows:

	KAYPRO	  H-89

	     2 to 3

	     3 to 2

	     5 to 4

	20-6-8
  (JUMP ALL 3) to 20

...and transferred several files at 9600 baud.
We did not try 19200, might work OK.
