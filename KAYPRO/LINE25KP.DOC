                   UNDOCUMENTED VIDEO FEATURES
                        FOR THE KAYPRO 10

                          By Ron Mozer

The KAYPRO 10 has several undocumented features available to the
user which are undocumented in any of the Kaypro manuals.  These
features include a 25'th line and the ability to save and recall
the cursor possition.  If you look at the owners manual for the
computer you will find a section which describes character attri-
butes commands.  These commands allow inverse video, blinking,
reduced intensity, etc.  This is documentation on two more of the
commands.

The table of commands can be updated to the following:

			To Turn ON:		To Turn OFF:

Inverse Video		ESC,"B0"		ESC,"C0"
Reduced Intensity	ESC,"B1"		ESC,"C1"
Blinking		ESC,"B2"		ESC,"C2"
Underlining		ESC,"B3"		ESC,"C3"
Cursor			ESC,"B4"		ESC,"C4"

Save Cursor Pos.	ESC,"B6"     To Recall  ESC,"C6" <--- New
25'th line 		ESC,"B7"		ESC,"C7" <--- New

As you can see there is an obvious gap for the "B5" - "C5" attri-
butes.  I have not found out what these do and would be interested
in hearing from anybody that does via the Mesilla Valley RCP/M
(505)522-8856.

What follows is a sample MBASIC program which demostrates these
features:

10 REM THIS PROGRAM WILL DEMONSTRATE THE 25'TH LINE AND OTHER FEATURES

140 PRINT "THIS IS THE 25'TH LINE" : REM SHOW USER WE CAN DO IT!
150 PRINT CHR$(27);"C6" : REM RECALL CURSOR POSSITION
160 REM WHEN YOUR DONE WITH THE 25'TH LINE IT MAY BE DISABLED
170 REM WITH THE FOLLOWING
