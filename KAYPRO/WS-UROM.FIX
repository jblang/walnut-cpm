After reading the articles in PROFILES on "Z", and discovering
that it was possible to buy a Z-system for my Kaypro 2x that
was already installed, I jumped at the chance. However, my
Kaypro 2x happens to be one of those Kaypros with U-ROM. Still
it_was_ possible to buy the Z-Com package and hope that it would
work on my system.

It worked beautifully; in fact I became very spoiled even by the
fact that it was no longer necessary to do a warm boot (^C) when
changing diskettes. Also, I liked the aliases, menus, vmenus and
vfiler right from the beginning.

It became evident very early on that my copy of Kaypro's Wordstar
was not in the_least_ compatible with my Z-Com system. Since
Wordstar is what I use most, I became more than anxious about
finding a way to use it with "Z".

I knew that Ted Silveira had had compatibility problems with
Wordstar along with another program he was using. He had left a
note on one of the boards about it, and stating that he had done
some patches, was still having problems, and was still experimenting.
So I left a message for him on the board, asking if he had solved
the problem yet, and could he help me.

He did come up with a suggestion of a patch that he felt would
work in my case. It had to do with Kaypro patching Wordstar so the
arrow keys would work. However, because of this patch, it wouldn't
work with "Z".

SO--I tried the patch, and now my copy of Wordstar works beautifully
with Z-Com, even when I use it inside the shell of a Vmenu, or Vfiler.
Here is my patch that Ted Silveira so willing gave me, and how I
did the patching. I will use "<" and ">" to indicate the entries
that I had to make.

  A0><DDT WS.COM <CR>>          (the <CR> means press the
      NEXT PC                    carriage return)
      4600 0100
      -<S0287 <CR>>
      0287 C3 <00> <CR>
      0288 D7 <00> <CR>
      0289 02 <C9> <CR>
      028A C3 <00> <CR>
      028B E4 <00> <CR>
      028C 02 <C9> <CR>
      028D 00 <.>  <CR>         (yes, a period)
      - <^C>                    (this means press the "CTRL"
                                 key and while holding it down,
                                 press the "C" key)
   A0><SAVE 69 WS.COM> <CR>

If you have version 3.0, you would <SAVE 62 WS.COM> <CR>.

I used the program "DDT.COM" that came with my Kaypro. So on the first
line at the A0> prompt, do the above. These addresses (i.e.0287 etc.)
are for Wordstar version 3.3. If you have version 3.0 or version 2.26
of Wordstar, here are the addresses you start at:

      2.26   3.0   3.3
      ----   ----  ----
      02A4   02A4  0287

The column after the addresses in the example above are the patches
that Kaypro had put into my version 3.3 (C3,D7,02,C3,E4,02) of
Wordstar. Just to recap it - I put 00 00 C9 00 00 C9 in place of
the other hexadecimal numbers that Kaypro had placed in Wordstar.

There, that's it. I hope you are using a "test" diskette with a
dispensable copy of your WS.COM, in case these patches don't work
for you. I just wanted to share this info with you, as maybe you
have had a few anxious moments when suddenly you discover that
your Kaypro Wordstar doesn't work with "Z".

All credit is given to Ted Silveira for the above patch and for
"saving the day". Many, many thanks, Ted.

And "Happy Word Processing with your Zs" to the rest of you.
