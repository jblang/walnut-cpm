PERFECT FILER CARRIAGE RETURNS
by Editor, KUGOR, July 1987

(How to get the pages to layout correctly)

A KUGOR member wants help with "Perfect Filer."  Apparently, no
matter how much he tries, he can't get the program to hold to a
66 line page.  It keeps on printing out, right over the paper
perfs, and begins new pages in the oddest places!

This is a common problem.  Blame it on "Filer's" terrible
documentation.  Simply put, when formatting a list, each time you
wish to begin a new line, you have to define a carriage return as
a separate Field Number and a string.  To skip a space, then, you
have to plug in two carriage returns.  And so on and so on...
This way you should have no trouble getting your lists to print
out the way you want them.
