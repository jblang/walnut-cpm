Hogan, Thom, OSBORNE CP/M USER GUIDE, Berkely: Osborne / Mcgraw-Hill 1981.
Price $12.99  - 283 Pages.

    CHAPTERS one thru eight: Intro to CP/M & Operating systems, CP/M
built-in commands, CP/M transient commands, Asm language utilities,
Other transient programs & CP/M, MP/M, CP/NET & CP/M derivatives,
Technical aspects of CP/M, Putting it all together: the systems
approach.  APPENDICES: CP/M command summary, ASCII character codes,
Comparisions of CP/M versions 1.3, 1.4 & 2.0, CP/M prompts, Diskette
selection, Annotated bibliography and CP/M address book.

    I rate this book the best overall because its easy reading style
will get you familiar with all the CP/M commands very quickly.  And it
explains some of the more difficult to understand CP/M facilities (e.g. 
modifying the BIOS), without talking over the beginner's head.
Appropriate comments on the different versions of CP/M are liberally
used in this book and will not confuse the beginner.

    Its best features include: an extensive magazine article list on
CP/M, languages, and utilities, error messages for each CP/M command are
listed immediately after its description, a brief description of the
more popular languages and a list of different cpu diskette formats.

Christiansen(sic)".


Zaks, Rodney, THE CP/M HANDBOOK with MP/M, Berkeley: Sybex 1980.
Price $14.95 - 321 Pages.

CHAPTERS one thru eight: Intro to CP/M & MP/M, CP/M & MP/M facilities,
Handling files with pip, Using the editor, Inside CP/M (and MP/M),
Reference guide to CP/M & MP/M commands & programs, Practical hints, and
The future. APPENDICES: Common CP/M error messages, Hex conversion
table, ASCII conversion table, Ed control characters, ED commands, Pip
device names, Pip keywords, Pip parameters, CP/M (and MP/M) commands,
Command editing controls, CP/M extension types, Supplies (checklist),
Computer room organization (checklist), Failure checklist, Basic trouble
shooting rules.

    This book is the best reference guide of all the CP/M books because
CP/M versions 1.4, 2.2 and MP/M commands are distinguished throughout. 
It uses a brute force method of explaining the various command options
otherwise I would rate it equal to the Osborne CP/M User Guide.  This is
the only book that describes the MP/M commands and it should be sitting
next to the console when using CP/M.
