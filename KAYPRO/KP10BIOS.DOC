                     BIOS for the Kaypro 10
                     ======================

The accompanying file is the BIOS source for my Kaypro 10
with the ZCPR3 initialization.  This BIOS works on Kaypro
10's with CP/M version 2.2D, 2.2F, and 2.2G.  IT has been
tested with all those versions.  There is a table of equates
in the beginning of the listing.  Set the one corresponding
to your CPM version to true and the other two to false and
you should be in business.

If you don't want the ZCPR3 buffer initialization, just set
the ZCPR3 equate to false and you have a "plain vanilla"
CPM system.
