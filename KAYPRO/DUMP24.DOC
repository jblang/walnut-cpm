Using Dump24

To use the screen to printer dump simply enter DUMP24 <carriage return>.
From then until you either reset your computer (with the button in back)
or turn it off, every time you hold the control key down and strike the W
(enter control W) every thing that you see on the screen of your Kaypro
will be sent to the printer. This is true even if you are in another program
such as DDT or your text editor.

Some people will not want to use control W for the screen dump character.
You may change the character to any thing you want but realize that the
character you use will be unavailable for its old purpose. Using control
W has worked for me because the only time I use to use control W was in
my text editor to move the cursor to the end of the next word. When the
screen dump is on this is no longer the case. Control W dumps the screen
to the printer and the editor never sees it.

To change the screen dump character use DDT. The process goes as follows.
Everything behind the semicolons are my comments:

A>DDT DUMP24.COM	;1. Enter this...DDT.COM must be on the disk  
DDT VERS 2.2
NEXT PC		;2. DDT prints this information about the program
0200 0100	; 	and itself
-S10B		;3. The minus sign is DDT's prompt I entered "S10B"
010B 17 00	;4. DDT printed the first 2 #'s I entered the number
		;   of the new character to use for the ScreenDump (00)
010C 32 .	;5. DDT printed the first 2 numbers I entered the period
-^C		;6. I enter a control C to exit DDT
Warm Boot	;7. The computers response

A>SAVE 1 NEWDS.COM	;8. Now save as a file called NEWDS.COM

In the above I changed the dump screen character form 17 hex(control W) to
00 hex (control @). The hex numbers for the control characters are listed
below. Now if I hit the reset button and enter NEWDS a control @ will dump
the screen to the printer.
