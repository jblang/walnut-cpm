	  /////////////////////////////////////////////////


	  A DOCUMENT TO EASE AND EXPLAIN THE IMPLEMENTATION
	  OF ZCPR3 AND THE NEW ZRDOS OPERATING SYSTEM ON
	  KAYPRO 4-84 COMPUTERS.

	  ZCPR3 IS NOT AN EASY THING TO INSTALL. CONSIDERABLE
	  KNOWLEDGE IS REQUIRED. MANY FILES ARE NECESSARY.
	  THERE IS MUCH READING TO BE DONE.

	  THE INTENT HERE IS TO PROVIDE AN EASY TO FOLLOW
	  INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR THE NOVICE LUCKY ENOUGH TO
	  POSSESS ALL NECESSARY ZCPR3 FILES. A GENERAL
	  FAMILIARITY WITH ZCPR3 IS ASSUMED.

	  EXPERIENCED PROGRAMMERS WILL PROBABLY FIND THIS
	  RESEARCH THE MOST USEFUL. IT DOCUMENTS THE CRITICAL
	  MEMORY LOCATIONS AND THEIR MANIPULATION FOR THE
	  SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF ZCPR3 ON THE KAYPRO 4-84.

	  A PERFUNCTORY DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO INSTALL ECHELON
	  INC's ZRDOS (CP/M BDOS REPLACEMENT) IS ALSO INCLUDED.

	  ZRDOS IS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND IS FAIRLY
	  SIMPLE TO GET UP & RUNNING. SIGNIFICANTLY THOUGH,
	  ZRDOS ISN'T NEARLY AS WORTHWHILE TO IMPLEMENT
	  WITHOUT A CONCURRENT IMPLEMENTATION OF ZCPR3. A
	  PROCEDURE OUTLINED HERE, STEP BY STEP.

Patches for the Kaypro 4-84 BIOS listed below were
developed by Barry Siegfried (K2MF), New York City, including
the cold boot initialization patch which is based on previous
work done for the installation of ZCPR2 on the Apple ][ series
of computers by Mike Cohen.

Here is what we will be installing:

 1. the CCP replacement
 2. the System Environment
 3. the System Flow Control Package
 4. the System Named Directory Package
 5. the System Resident Command Package
 6. the External Message Buffer
 7. the External File Control Block
 8. the Multiple Command Buffer
 9. the Shell Stack
10. the External Stack
11. the External Path
12. the BIOS cold boot initialization patch

The files required to do the installation are:

System .COM files
-----------------
1. CPM63.COM  - DRI 63K CP/M System image (SYSGEN) for
		Kaypro 4-84 series computers, version 2.20G
		(You will create this file in a moment using
		the CP/M utility called SYSGEN.COM.)
2. SYSGEN.COM - Digital Research SYStem GENerating utility.
3. DDT.COM    - Digital Research Dynamic Debugging Tool  - or -
   ZDT.COM    - Public Domain Z80 Debugging Tool
4. MAC.COM    - Digital Research Macro Assembler
5. MLOAD.COM  - Public domain replacement for Digital Research LOAD.COM
6. your program text editor, such as Wordstar.

ZCPR3 Source files
------------------
1. ZCPR3.ASM  - the working code for the CCP replacement
2. Z3BASE.LIB - Base address definition library for the ZCPR3 CCP
		replacement and external packages
3. Z3HDR.LIB  - Option selection library for the ZCPR3 CCP replacement
4. SYSENV.ASM & SYSENV.LIB - ZCPR3 Environment Descriptors
5. SYSFCP.ASM & SYSFCP.LIB - ZCPR3 Flow Control Package
6. SYSNDR.ASM & SYSNDR.LIB - ZCPR3 Named Directory Package
7. SYSRCP.ASM & SYSRCP.LIB - ZCPR3 Resident Command Package

ZCPR3 Application programs
--------------------------
1. Z3INS.COM - ZCPR3 System Environment .COM file installer
2. LDR.COM   - ZCPR3 External Package loader
3. ALIAS.COM - ZCPR3 command .COM file creator


THEORY OF OPERATION
-------------------
The DRI 63K CP/M System version 2.20G occupies the following
addresses in the Kaypro 4-84 memory:

CCP : E000 - E7FF (2k)	  BDOS: E800 - F5FF (3.5K)
BIOS: F600 - F9FF
CP/M application programs always protect the BDOS and BIOS sections of
the CP/M System, because these are the parts which provide the Basic
Disk Operating System and Hardware I/O services that these programs
utilize to perform their functions.  The "JMP BDOS" instruction that
resides at location 5 which is set up by the BIOS during the cold boot
process provides a reliable means by which an application program can
determine where the BDOS begins, and what address above which the pro-
gram may not write into memory.

If an additional patch could be made in the user's BIOS whereby a
fake JMP instruction to a lower address in memory can be placed
at location 5, and a JMP BDOS can be placed at that lower
address, then all memory above the new lower address would be
protected by application programs because these programs would
"think" that the BDOS started at the lower address.  This is what
we will do to fully implement ZCPR3 on the Kaypro 4-84.


I - GENERATING CPM63.COM FROM SYSGEN
    --------------------------------
     We will preserve an image of the Kaypro's 63k CP/M operating
     system (the one it came with) using the SYSGEN.COM utility
     from the CP/M disk. SYSGEN is a program allowing the user
     to move an operating system from one disk to another.
     The operating system is located on the outer edge of each
     disk - on tracks 0 and 1.

1. Insert a disk in Drive A: containing SYSGEN.COM and your stock
   Kaypro 63K CP/M System.  Then, insert a blank (but properly
   formatted) disk into drive B:

2. Run SYSGEN and at the "SOURCE DRIVE" prompt, press "A". This
   informs SYSGEN that the operating system on Drive A: will be
   considered the source for what follows:

3. At the "DESTINATION DRIVE" prompt, which will appear next, hit
   "RETURN." This will exit you from SYSGEN and bring you back to
   CP/M's A0> prompt.

4. At the A0> prompt, type A0>SAVE 36 B:CPM63.COM

   In doing this, you preserve 36 pages of computer memory in a
   file on Drive B: that is now called CPM63.COM. Those memory
   pages contain an image of your stock CP/M operating system..
   (and also a copy of SYSGEN.COM.)


II - INSTALLING ZCPR3:
     ----------------

Prepare the following disks:

Drive A: DDT.COM (or ZDT.COM), MAC.COM, MLOAD.COM, your text editor
Drive B: (Disk 1) - ZCPR3.ASM, Z3BASE.LIB, Z3HDR.LIB

Drive B: (Disk 2) - CPM63.COM, SYSENV.ASM, SYSENV.LIB, Z3INS.COM,
		    LDR.COM, ALIAS.COM
Drive B: (Disk 3) - SYSFCP.ASM, SYSFCP.LIB, SYSNDR.ASM, SYSNDR.LIB,
		    SYSRCP.ASM, SYSRCP.LIB



Disk 1 (Drive B:)
-----------------
1. Edit Z3BASE.LIB and put in the base addresses for your system com-
   ponents as desired.	It is suggested that you use the values in the
   following table, although they may be changed as desired.
   When you finish editing Z3BASE.LIB, transfer a copy of it to
   Disk 3, as it is needed to prepare the external packages of ZCPR3.


MEMORY LOCATION   SIZE in (b)ytes & (K)ilobytes    Z3BASE.LIB
---------------   ------------------------------   --------------------
0040 - 0046	    7 b  External Search Path	   EXPATH   EQU  40H
			 3 External Search Paths   EXPATHS  EQU  3
004B		    1 b  Wheel Byte		   WHEEL    EQU  4BH
D209 - D258	   80 b  External Message Buffer   Z3MSG    EQU  0D209H
D25C - D27F	   36 b  Ext. File Control Block   EXTFCB   EQU  0D25CH
D280 - D2FF	  128 b  Named Directory Package   Z3NDIR   EQU  0D280H
			 7 Named Directories	   Z3NDIRS  EQU  7
D300 - D3FF	  256 b  Multiple Command Buffer   Z3CL     EQU  0D300H
			 251 Characters Maximum    Z3CLS    EQU  251
D400 - D4BF	  192 b  Shell Stack		   SHSTK    EQU  0D400H
			 6 Shell Stacks 	   SHSTKS   EQU  6
			 1 Shell Stack = 32 bytes  SHSIZE   EQU  32
D4D0 - D4FF	   48 b  External Stack 	   EXTSTK   EQU  0D4D0H
D500 - D5FF	  256 b  Environment Descriptor    Z3ENV    EQU  0D500H
			  2 128-byte blocks	   Z3ENVS   EQU  2
D600 - D7FF	  512 b  Flow Control Package	   FCP	    EQU  0D600H
			  4 128-byte blocks	   FCPS     EQU  4
D800 - DFFF	    2 K  Resident Command Package  RCP	    EQU  0D800H
			 16 128-byte blocks	   RCPS     EQU  16
E000 - E7FF	    2 K  CCP			   CCP	    EQU  0E000H

2. Edit Z3HDR.LIB and select the options you desire for your CCP.  It
   is suggested that you turn on only the following CCP Resident Com-
   mands:  GET, GO, JUMP, REN and SAVE.  GET, GO, JUMP and SAVE are
   available only in the CCP.  Even though REN is available in the
   External Resident Command Package, I elect to turn it on in the
   CCP because it does not appreciably add to the amount of generated
   code in the CCP while it saves very valuable space in the External
   Resident Command Package by not turning it on there.


3. Log into Drive B: and assemble ZCPR3.ASM using MAC:

   B0>A:MAC ZCPR3 $PZ-S

   Using the $PZ-S option of MAC will give you the fastest assembly
   without generating a large .PRN file.  If the generated code in
   your CCP is larger than 2K, an error message will print out at the
   end of assembly.  When assembly is complete you will find ZCPR3.HEX
   on Disk 1.

4. Generate the binary code from the .HEX file using MLOAD:

   B0>A:MLOAD ZCPR3

   When the load is complete you will find ZCPR3.COM on Disk 1.

5. REName ZCPR3.BIN=ZCPR3.COM  - and -	transfer a copy of ZCPR3.BIN
   to Disk 2.


Disk 2 (Drive B:)
-----------------
1. Edit SYSENV.LIB and put in your terminal control codes.  It is
   suggested that you use the values in the following table for the
   "videoable" Kaypro 4-84:

envorg2:
	DB	'KAYPRO 4-84	 '	;Name of Terminal
	DB	05h			;*Cursor UP
	DB	18h			;*Cursor DOWN
	DB	04h			;*Cursor RIGHT
	DB	13h			;*Cursor LEFT
	DB	00			;CL Delay
	DB	00			;CM Delay
	DB	00			;CE Delay
	DB	1Ah,0			;CL String
	DB	1Bh,'=%+ %+ ',0 	;CM String
	DB	18h,0			;CE String
	DB	1Bh,'B0',1Bh,'B1',0	;SI String
	DB	1Bh,'C1',1Bh,'C0',0	;SO String
	DB	0			;TI String
	DB	0			;TE String

	ds	80H-($-envorg2) 	; make exactly 80H bytes long


2. Log into Drive B: and assemble SYSENV.ASM using MAC:

   B0>A:MAC SYSENV $PZ-S

   When assembly is complete you will find SYSENV.HEX on Disk 2.

3. Generate the binary code from the .HEX file using MLOAD:

   B>A:MLOAD SYSENV

   When the load is complete you will find SYSENV.COM on Disk 2.

4. REName SYS.ENV=SYSENV.COM

5. Read ZCPR3.BIN into your SYSGEN program using DDT (or ZDT):
      - special note: Ideally, SYS.ENV should be loaded along
	with ZCPR3.BIN. But I have been unable to locate space
	in the Kaypro's memory to place the Environment.
	That means SYS.ENV must be placed on each ZCPR3 disk.
	It will be loaded automatically upon cold boot but
	it remains a seperate file.

B0>A:DDT (or ZDT) CPM63.COM

* You will see the following:

B0>A:DDT CPM63.COM
DDT VERS 2.2
NEXT  PC
2500 0100
-

* The "-" is DDT"s (and ZDT's) prompt. Enter the following sequence
of instructions:

   /-----/---/------ Type-in all of this.
-F0980,117F,0	    (initialize the CPR image area to 00)
-IZCPR3.BIN	    (identify the binary CPR image)
-R0880		    (read the binary CPR image into CPM63.COM
		     at location 0980)
-G0

* A WARM BOOT will now occur, bringing you back to CP/M and the
B0> prompt. Do this next:

B0>SAVE 36 ZCPR3.COM
* This combines the ZCPR3 system which you created above with
  the stock CP/M system that previously had been combined into
  SYSGEN.COM.

  This new program - called ZCPR3.COM - will be the program you
  use to put ZCPR3 onto the system tracks of whatever disks you
  choose. Instructions for doing that are soon to come - but
  first, some major adjustments must be made so that ZCPR3 will
  operate correctly on the Kaypro 4-84:

III - INSTALL BIOS COLD BOOT PATCHES
      ------------------------------

1.  Load ZCPR3.COM (the program you've just made) into DDT (or ZDT):

    B0>A:DDT (or ZDT) ZCPR3.COM
    DDT VERS 2.2
    NEXT  PC
    2500 0100
    -

2.  Define the External Search Path (which gets moved to 0040 in the
    initialization patch):

    -S0950  (You type S0950 at the "-" prompt, then enter only
	    the last two numbers on each line in the following
	    sequence. Make sure you get numbers identical to
	    these as you proceed.

	     /----------------------------- you type these
    0950 00 24	($ = Current Drive) ------- what they control
    0951 00 00	(User 0)
    0952 00 01	(Drive A:)
    0953 00 24	($ = Current User)
    0954 00 01	(Drive A:)
    0955 00 00	(User 0)
    0956 00 00	(Terminator - 7 bytes total)
    0957 00 .	<- that's a PERIOD. Type it and hit RETURN.)
    -


    The above represents 3 external search paths.  You may specify up
    to 5 paths (2 byte pairs per path) in the space from 0950 thru
    095A, however, you must also remember to change the EXPATHS equate
    in Z3BASE.LIB.

3.  Initialize the Wheel Byte (which gets moved to 004B in the
    initialization patch):

    -S095B --/----------------------------- you type these
    095B 00 FF	(004B wheel byte set on)
    095C 00 .	<- don't forget the PERIOD
    -

4.  Setup the Multiple Command Buffer and define the cold boot auto-
    start command (which gets moved to D300 in the initialization
    patch):

    * (CONTINUE YOUR INPUT BELOW JUST AS YOU'VE DONE ABOVE. ENTER
      EVERYTHING YOU SEE FOLLOWING THE "-" AND ONLY THE LAST 2
      NUMBERS OR A "."	WHEN THERE'S NO "-")

    -S0960
    0960 00 04	(Address of first character in Mult. Comm. Buff. - LSB)
    0961 00 D3	(Address of first character in Mult. Comm. Buff. - MSB)
    0962 00 FB	(Max. # of chars. permitted in Mult. Comm. Buff. - 251)
    0963 00 00	(Char. count in Mult. Comm. Buff. initialized to 00)
    0964 00 .
    -F0964,097E,20  (fill cold boot autostart command area with spaces
		     - 27 bytes)
    -S097F
    097F 00 00	(Terminate cold boot autostart command area with 00 -
    0980 00 .	 32 bytes total)
    -

5.  Create the initialization patch (runs at FA10):



    -S0910
    0910 00 01	(LXI B)
    0911 00 F7	(3575 bytes to initialize)
    0912 00 0D
    0913 00 21	(LXI H)
    0914 00 09	(D209 address to start initializing)
    0915 00 D2
    0916 00 36	(MVI M)
    0917 00 00	(00)
    0918 00 23	(INX H)
    0919 00 0B	(DCX B)
    091A 00 78	(MOV A,B)
    091B 00 B1	(ORA C)
    091C 00 20	(JRNZ)
    091D 00 F8	(to 0916)
    091E 00 01	(LXI B)
    091F 00 0C	(12 bytes to move)
    0920 00 00
    0921 00 21	(LXI H)
    0922 00 50	(FA50 address to move from)
    0923 00 FA
    0924 00 11	(LXI D)
    0925 00 40	(0040 address to move to)
    0926 00 00
    0927 00 ED	(LDIR)
    0928 00 B0	(move memory)
    0929 00 01	(LXI B)
    092A 00 20	(32 bytes to move)
    092B 00 00
    092C 00 21	(LXI H)
    092D 00 60	(FA60 address to move from)
    092E 00 FA
    092F 00 11	(LXI D)
    0930 00 00	(D300 address to move to)
    0931 00 D3
    0932 00 ED	(LDIR)
    0933 00 B0	(move memory)
    0934 00 21	(LXI H)
    0935 00 4A	(F64A)
    0936 00 F6
    0937 00 C3	(JMP)
    0938 00 BD	(F6BD)
    0939 00 F6
    093A 00 .
    -

6.  Create the routine which lowers the BDOS address (runs at FA3A).
    Accumulator contains a JMP when this routine is called.

    -S093A
    093A 00 32	(STA)
    093A 00 06	(D206 new lower BDOS address)
    093B 00 D2
    093C 00 21	(LXI H)
    093D 00 06	(E806 real BDOS address)
    093E 00 E8
    093F 00 22	(SHLD)
    0940 00 07	(D207 holds real BDOS address)
    0941 00 D2
    0942 00 21	(LXI H)
    0943 00 06	(D206 new lower BDOS address)
    0944 00 D2
    0945 00 C9	(RET to caller which stores new lower BDOS address
		 at location 6)
    0946 00 .
    -

7.  Install cold start patches in BIOS:

    * HERE, THE "A" COMMAND MEANS YOU WILL BE ENTERING
      ACTUAL ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE INSTRUCTIONS. SO TYPE "JMP"
      OR "CALL" WHERE INDICATED FOLLOWED BY THE 4 LETTER &
      NUMBER COMBINATIONS WHICH REPRESENT MEMORY ADDRESSES.


    -A203A ---------> read the above paragraph again if you're
		      not sure what to type...
	   /----/---> type these..
    203A JMP FA10     (jumps to initialization routine)
    203D .	      <--- don't forget the PERIOD.

    -A2087
    2087 CALL FA3A  (calls routine which lowers the BDOS address)
    208A .
    -


8.  Patch warm start so new CPR is not disturbed by the BIOS:

    -A2090
    2090 JMP F722
    2093 .
    -F2093,20A1,0
    -S210B
    210B 32 00	(NOP)
    210C 07 00	(NOP)
    210D E0 00	(NOP)
    210E    .
    -F2273,22FF,0
    -

 9. Exit DDT (or ZDT) and save patched ZCPR3.COM:

    -G0  (return to CP/M)
    B0>SAVE 36 ZCPR3.COM

You now have a file that will generate ZCPR3 and place it in the
operating system tracks of as many disks as you choose. Simply
insert it into the A: drive, put the disk to which you wish to
transfer the system in the B: drive, run ZCPR3.... answer it's
questions and PRESTO - you're in business. Remember though, to
"initialize" your memory with ZCPR, you must RESET the computer
before inserting the ZCPR system disk. Once that is done, the
Kaypro will "read-in" the ZCPR3 system just as it did your stock
CP/M system.


IV - INSTALL OTHER ZCPR3 FILES
     -------------------------

1. Install your Environment Descriptors into LDR.COM and ALIAS.COM
   using Z3INS:

   B0>Z3INS SYS.ENV LDR.COM  - and -  B0>Z3INS SYS.ENV ALIAS.COM

   This procedure will be used from here on to install ZCPR3-specific
   utility programs.  Once installed, they may be run freely on your
   ZCPR3 System without re-installation.


Disk 3 (Drive B:)
-----------------
1. Edit SYSFCP.LIB, SYSNDR.LIB and SYSRCP.LIB and select the options
   you desire for your external Flow Control, Named Directory and Res-
   ident Command Packages, respectively.  It is suggested that you
   turn off the REN External Resident Command in SYSRCP.LIB.  You
   might additionally need to turn off other options and commands in
   order to get SYSRCP.ASM to assemble to within 2K of code.  It is
   STRONGLY suggested that you DO NOT revise the External Resident
   Command equates in Z3BASE.LIB in order to accommodate an External
   Resident Command Package that is greater than 2K.

2. Log into Drive B: and assemble SYSFCP.ASM, SYSNDR.ASM and
   SYSRCP.ASM using MAC:

   B>A:MAC SYSFCP $PZ-S  - and -  B>A:MAC SYSNDR $PZ-S	- and -
   B>A:MAC SYSRCP $PZ-S

   When all three assemblies are complete you will find SYSFCP.HEX,
   SYSNDR.HEX and SYSRCP.HEX on Disk 3.

3. Generate the binary code from the .HEX files using MLOAD:

   B>A0:MLOAD SYSFCP  - and -  B>A0:MLOAD SYSNDR  - and -
   B>A0:MLOAD SYSRCP

   When all three loads are complete you will find SYSFCP.COM,
   SYSNDR.COM and SYSRCP.COM on Disk 3.

4. REName SYS.FCP=SYSFCP.COM  - and -  REName SYS.NDR=SYSNDR.COM
   - and -  REName SYS.RCP=SYSRCP.COM

ZCPR3.COM is now ready to generate new system disks.


To generate a new system disk, A>ZCPR3 x:, where x is a valid drive
with a formatted disk in it.  When you boot a ZCPR3 disk, SYS.ENV
must be present. In the configuration you have just created, LDR
will then automatically load the environment. After the disk has
booted, you may load any or all of the external packages using LDR:

A0>LDR SYS.FCP,SYS.NDR,SYS.RCP ... etc.

These packages will load into their designated protected areas set
aside by the ZCPR3 system and defined in SYS.ENV, and will not be
overwritten by application programs.


ZCPR3 is a flexible and much improved Console Command Processor over
the stock Digital Research CCP which contains a variety of new funct-
ions and commands, particularly if the external packages are loaded.
In addition, there are many ZCPR3-specific programs which can now run
on your Kaypro 4-84 system that offer very interesting video capabili-
ties.  For more information about ZCPR3, write or call:

and order "ZCPR3 - The Manual" for $19.95.  This manual contains all
the technical information about ZCPR3 theory, design, installation and
usage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ZCPR3 is not permanent! To get rid of it, simply RESET or POWER
DOWN your machine. If you insert a "stock" CP/M disk into A:
following either of those steps, you will be running Kaypro's
"as delivered" CP/M operating system.

Similarly, following a RESET or POWER-DOWN, placing a ZCPR3
disk in A: will give you back the ZCPR3 system.

					       ZRDOS INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ZRDOS is NOT a public domain program. It is a commercial product
written by Dennis Wright and available for sale through ECHELON
INC. It has copyrights in the years 1984 and 1985 by Mr. Wright.

ZRDOS replaces the BDOS portion of your CP/M system. When installed
on your system, it becomes the ACTUAL OPERATING SYSTEM for your
computer. Since ECHELON markets documentation for this product, I
cannot extensively reveal those contents. Though I heartily recommend
that you purchase and install ZRDOS - and use it in conjunction with
the ZCPR3 system, also marketed by ECHELON though available in the
Public Domain, particularly on Z-NODES.

(By the way, when ZRDOS and ZCPR3 are combined, you can say your
computer is running the Z-SYSTEM - not CP/M or CP/M augmented by
ZCPR3.)

Installation of ZRDOS is a snap compared to the installation of
ZCPR3. Since you will have PURCHASED ZRDOS, you will have received
an installation file called ZRD+INS.COM.
You will also be in possession of the other program utilities
which function under ZRDOS and enhance the operation of your
system.

I - TO INSTALL ZRDOS
    ----------------

    1. Run the ZRD+INS.COM file ->   A0>ZRD+INS

    2. You will be asked for the location of your "Wheel Byte."
       For the Kaypro 4-84, the answer is: 4B

    3. You will then be asked for the address at which your
       system's BDOS begins.  For the Kaypro 4-84, the answer
       is: E800.

    4. ZRD+INS.COM will now create a file called ZRDOS+.BIN,
       which is simply a binary image of your ZRDOS replacement
       assembled to run at the address you specified above, much
       the same as ZCPR3.BIN was the binary image of your ZCPR3
       CCP replacement (CPR).

    5. You will now merge this file with your ZCPR3.COM file
       using DDT or ZDT. This will provide you with a program
       that will allow you to place a complete Z-SYSTEM on as
       many disks as you wish, using the technique described
       above for the ZCPR3 installation:

A0>DDT (or ZDT) ZCPR3.COM
DDT VERS 2.2
NEXT  PC
2500 0100
-IZRDOS+.BIN
-R1080

-G0

(YOUR MACHINE WILL NOW WARM BOOT AND THEN YOU TYPE:)

A0>SAVE 36 ZSYSTEM.COM

       And ZSYSTEM.COM is what you've been after. A completely
       new operating system. It is functional, friendly and even
       futuristic. It utilizes the extended instruction capability
       of the Z80 microprocessor and has the utility of the ZCPR3
       Console Command Processor Replacement.
