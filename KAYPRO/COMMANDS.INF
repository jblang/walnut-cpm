This system no longer operates under ZCPR2.  Too many serious bugs
prevent its use on this systems.  Until they are exterminated, 
"good-ole" CP/M 2.2 will be at the helm.  THEREFORE, commands are
standard--i.e. USER 1 logs to user area 1, etc.  

Drives A and B User areas 0 to 5 are available to the public.  Drive
C is online but is not open to public use.  None of the commands operate
there---not even DIR.

DIR

The directory program allows you to view nonsystem files and
library files on the both the A and B drive, user areas 0 through
5.  Area 6 on both drives are open only to subscribers and
invited guests.  Areas 7 through 15 are reserved for my use only.
Use the dir command as you normally do.  

LDIR

Since many of the files on both drives are arranged into
libraries, the command LDIR is important.  It allows you to look
into library files to see what programs are there.  To do this,
merely type  LDIR LIBRARYNAME.  FOR EXAMPLE:  to view the
contents of the library file BUGBYTE.LBR, type LDIR BUGBYTE.  The
contents will be displayed.

LTYPE

To read document and ASCII files contained within library files,
you need to use LTYPE.  To do so, type LTYPE LIBRARYNAME FILENAME.EXT.
Of course you would first need to know the name of the file you
wish to see.  You can find this out by using LDIR (described
above).  This program also allows you to view squeezed files!!

SYSMAP

Files are arranged into USER AREAS by type.  SYSMAP simply shows you
the available user areas and what they contain.

SYSCOM

SYSCOM quickly shows you the available commands and a brief
description of what they do---remember this one---it is a nice
reference. 

FILE

FILE shows you where a file is located on disk.  For example, to
find the file named BIGBONG.ASM you simply type FILE BIGBONG.ASM
and the program will search all available user areas and will
tell you where the program may be found.  You then simply log to
that area.  FILE also accepts wildcards; ie *.* references.

CHAT

When all else fails or you can't find what you need, type CHAT to
see if I am around.  If I am, I will be happy to help you out.
DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE CHAT---I LIKE TO TYPE.

XFERTIME

If you want to know how long a file transfer will take BEFORE you
commit yourself to XMODEM, type XFERTIME FILENAME.EXT.  The
program will tell you how long transfer time is at various baud
speeds.  You will quickly see the advantage to 1200 baud transfer!!

BBS P

If for any reason you wish to return to the Bulletin Board from
CP/M, you do so by typing BBS P.  This will put you back into the
program with going through all of the scrolling you saw when you
first entered the system.

XMODEM

For transfer of both ASCII and BINARY files, a program called
XMODEM is used.  It is designed to work with MODEM7 or a
compatible program using the CHRISTENSEN PROTOCOL.  To get a good
description of its commands, type XMODEM.  The built in DOC
prompt will describe the commands for you.  NOTE this version is
used for ALL files including SQUEEZED and LIBRARY transfer---a
beautiful version of an old favorite.

TYPE

TYPE is used to view both SQUEEZED and UNSQUEEZED ASCII files. 
This version may also be used with wildcards---*.*

 
BYE

The command BYE signs off the system WITHOUT allowing the caller
to enter a comment---IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE A COMMENT BEFORE EXIT,
YOU MUST SIGN OFF THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM.

CAT

CAT is WARD CHRISTENSEN's CATALOG program.  Use this command to
check the ARCHIVE FILES for a program not found on the A or the B
drives.  To use this command type CAT FILENAME.EXT.  A search
will be made and you will be told if the file exists in archives.
You may ask that it be loaded by either using CHAT or by leaving
a message on the BBS


I am adding programs to the drives daily.  HOWVEVER, even 10 MB
is limited when talking about the multitude of public domain
programs available.  Therefore, I will only have the latest
updates to many of the programs listed.  If for some reason you
want or need an older version, leave a message on the Bulletin
Board for me to look for it in archives and put it up for you to
get the next time you call.  This also applies to programs you
don't find on the system.  I may have the program but have not
yet put it on the system.  I welcome and encourge file uploading. 
Through your support, this system can grow so all can prosper. 
The XMODEM program will automatically receive programs you send
and place them on B6.  PLEASE PLEASE send some sort of
documentation with your program.

I hope you enjoy the system and I would appreciate any comments
you might have about it.  Just leave me a note at sign off
through the bulletin board.  

Thanks
